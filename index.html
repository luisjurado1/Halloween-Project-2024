    <h2>üïØÔ∏è History of Halloween</h2>
    <p>
      Halloween, also known as **All Hallows' Eve**, is celebrated on **October 31st**. Its roots stretch back over
      2,000 years to the ancient Celtic festival of **Samhain**, which marked the end of the harvest season and the
      onset of winter‚Äîa time believed to be vulnerable to spirits and the supernatural. During Samhain, Celts would
      light bonfires and wear costumes made of animal skins to ward off ghostly entities believed to roam the earth.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
      **Vivid Traditions**: Revelers would also leave food offerings outside their homes to appease wandering spirits,
      believing that their deceased ancestors would return to visit. This duality created a festival of both fear and
      celebration, setting the stage for modern Halloween customs.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
      **Roman Influence**: When the Romans conquered Celtic territories, they integrated their own harvest
      festivals‚Äîspecifically **Feralia**, which honored the dead, and **Pomona**, dedicated to the goddess of fruit and
      trees. These traditions further contributed to Samhain's evolution into our contemporary Halloween.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
      In the 9th century, the Catholic Church established **November 1st** as **All Saints' Day**, superseding Samhain.
      The evening before became known as **All Hallows' Eve**, which eventually morphed into **Halloween**.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
      **Popularity in America**: Halloween‚Äôs journey to the United States took off in the mid-19th century due to **mass
      Irish immigration**, which brought their traditions with them. By the late 1800s, Halloween had transformed into a
      community-centered holiday, with fun activities such as **costume parades, parties**, and the now-famous
      **trick-or-treating** tradition beginning to take shape.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
      **Significant Milestones**:
      - **1920s**: The modern trick-or-treating tradition began to emerge, marking the shift from a day of superstition
      to one of fun and festivity.
      - **1950s**: Halloween gained commercial appeal in American culture, with the mass production of costumes and
      decorations, making it one of the most profitable holidays in the United States.
    </p>
    <br>
        <p>
      Today, Halloween is celebrated by millions around the world, showcasing a blend of ancient traditions and modern
      festivities, blending fear, fun, and a dash of creativity into one spooky evening. From haunted houses to spooky
      movies, the spirit of Halloween continues to thrive, captivating the imagination of young and old alike!

      <h3>üåï Origins</h3>
      <div <p><strong>Celtic Festival of Samhain:</strong> Halloween's roots can be traced back to the ancient Celtic
        festival of Samhain, where bonfires were lit and costumes worn to fend off evil spirits. This festive night
        marked the end of the harvest season and the beginning of winter, a time when the Celts believed that the veil
        between the living and the dead was thinnest.</p>
        <br>
        <p><strong>Roman Influences:</strong> With the Roman conquest of the Celtic territories, the traditions of two
          Roman festivals‚ÄîFeralia and Pomona‚Äîwere intertwined with the celebration of Samhain, creating a rich blend of
          customs.</p>
        <br>
        <p><strong>Christian Adaptation:</strong> The Catholic Church established November 1st as All Saints' Day in the
          9th century, and the evening before became known as All Hallows' Eve, which eventually evolved into Halloween.

          costumes and visiting homes for sweet treats!</li>
        <br>
        <li><strong>Jack-o'-lanterns:</strong> Carving pumpkins is a cherished tradition that originated from an Irish
          myth about Stingy Jack. The evolution of this practice has led to modern designs that populate porches and
          windows during Halloween.</li>
        <br>
